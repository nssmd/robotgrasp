## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Dexterous grasp detection is crucial for stable robotic manipulation, yet most methods rely on **RGB-D or depth images**, limiting their ability to utilize other **robotic state inputs**, such as **grasp poses and joint configurations**.

ðŸ”¥ **We propose DexGraspDetector, a novel approach integrating:**
- **Geometric Learning** with PointNet++ for feature extraction
- **Force-Closure Analysis** for grasp stability
- **An Attention Mechanism** to balance multimodal inputs dynamically

ðŸ“ˆ **Our model achieves 93.2% accuracy**, surpassing existing methods and demonstrating the advantages of integrating **physical stability constraints**.
